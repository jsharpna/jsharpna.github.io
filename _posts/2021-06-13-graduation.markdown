I was blessed to see three of my Ph.D. students graduate, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.

### Shitong Wei

**Thesis:** Multidimensional Graph Trend Filtering

Shitong has produced a nice body of work on trend filtering for exponential families in multiple dimensions. One application was adaptive small area estimation for Covid-19 case proportion in CA.
A common approach to dealing with small counts in epidemiology is to average over large spatial regions.
The idea behind her method is that if you have low counts during a time period than you need to have a more coarse spatial resolution.
You can do this using spatio-temporal graph trend filtering with the Poisson likelihood.
In the image below you can see the different spatial regions identified during a low count (left) and high count (right) time period.
