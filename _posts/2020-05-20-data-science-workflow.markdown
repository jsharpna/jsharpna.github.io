I have pinned down my data science/machine learning workflow and wanted to share it.  It is based on using `pip`, `virtualenv`, and `pycharm` and is good for simultaneously writing python packages and doing data analyses in `jupyter`.  My preferred infrastructure solution is AWS.  Disclaimer: I work for Amazon AWS.

### EC2 setup

I consolidate my EC2 setup using `.ssh/Config`, this greatly reduces my setup time.  First, I fire up an EC2 instance, using an AMI such as one of the Deep Learning community images.

### Python packages and virtualenv on server

### Pycharm

### Jupyter

### Other AWS services

- sagemaker
- Athena
- S3
