## New results on consistency of nearest neighbor matching

I published (finally) my paper on Nearest Neighbor Matching (NNM) in IEEE TransIT.
It basically shows that if you have a biased partially missing sample, where X is non-missing and Y is missing for the population of interest, then it works to just match the partially missing data to the non-missing biased sample to estimate the population mean of Y
